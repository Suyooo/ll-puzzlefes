    <div slot="hint">
        All three of the hint images are about swimming, but in different ways. What different ways of swimming are
        there?<br>
        The last image is of someone swimming while looking upwards instead of into the water.
    </div>
    <div slot="explain">
        The images are showing three different swimming styles - "crawl", "butterfly" and "backstroke".<br>
        Matching the symbols below the hints to the ones below results in the answer "ferry".
    </div>
    <div slot="loc">
        Almost 100% the same as the original puzzle, except for the answer.<br>
        It was almost a little awkward because the English hints are obviously way longer than the Japanese words for
        them in terms of character count, but luckily it was still big enough to have the hint symbols be recognizable.
        <br><br>
        An alternative localization idea was to change the swimming styles into high dive positions ("straight", "tuck"
        and "pike"), but I was unable to find an answer that was good enough for that set of letters. It wasn't much
        easier with the swimming styles though - all of the hints are missing "i", so a lot of good answer words, like
        "uniform", "sailor" or "captain" were knocked out right away...
