        The image represents the word "dreaming". Assigning the letters to the symbols and replacing the symbols in the
        second line with those letters reveals the answer "ramen".

    <div slot="loc">
        Same approach as in the original: the first line reveals all but one character, which must be filled in by
        yourself. Had a choice between a couple possible words, but went with "dancer" since it's the most fitting for
        Rin, and the "run" from the original was also in reference to her. The first line's word changed from a verb to
        a noun though - I wonder if that is more confusing to people who cleared the Japanese puzzle than those who see
        it for the first time?<br><br>
        Doesn't matter much anyways, because I made sure that the obvious answer is still obvious. Because, you know, if
        you're supposed to answer Rin's Puzzle with a type of food, how many possible answers are there, really.
