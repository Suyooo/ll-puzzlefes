        Try describing how the two characters are placed relative to each other.<br>
        You probably know what word the icon in the first line is supposed to represent. Try writing it out, and see
        whether anything catches your eye.
    </div>
    <div slot="explain">
        The first line has a "w" inside a "k". "w in k" - resulting in "wink".<br>
        By the same logic, a "y" inside a "sh" gives you the answer "shiny".

        No notes, this is literally just the original puzzle copypasted :^) I didn't do anything except slap on the
        usual translated template bits
