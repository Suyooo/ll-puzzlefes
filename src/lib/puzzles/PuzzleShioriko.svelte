        The small symbols in the drawing are representing people.<br>
        What situations can you think of where there is one person in front of many others?
    </div>
    <div slot="explain">
        The drawing represents a classroom. The blue triangle icon is the "teacher", and each of the yellow circles is a
        "student". Using the numbered slots on the right, you can spell out the answer, "neat".
    </div>
    <div slot="loc">
        This is almost a straight translation: The two clues are the same, and even the answer is very close - "seiton"
        means "orderliness", and Shio is a very "neat" person.<br><br>
        I happy with the puzzle like that - I'm not going to try to recreate the detail from the original where the
        clues only have letters from the answer, because I don't think it influences how you approach the puzzle. And
        also because I refuse to touch the word "mechanotransduction".
