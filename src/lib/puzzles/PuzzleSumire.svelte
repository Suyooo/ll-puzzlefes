        The answer is "showbiz".

    <div slot="loc">
        In the original puzzle, the rhymes were "minna" (everyone), "ginga" (galaxy) and "jinja" (shrine).<br>
        The choice for the clues and answers basically came down to "which word can I do fun rhymes with". Another thing
        I wanted though is some vagueness on the answer.<br>
        Yeah, I could have picked "shrine" as the answer and I'd have had a lot of rhymes to use, but the point of the
        original puzzle is that shrines have many different words to use in Japanese, and you can lock down which one
        is the correct one by using rhymes. Meanwhile, English only has "shrine" - maybe "temple", but the official
        translations only use the former word - so it would be obvious even without considering rhyming.<br>
        With "showbiz" as the answer, the words I had to choose as rhymes are a little stinky maybe, but the prompt is
        very open and challenges you to figure out rhymes that work here.
