        The key to this puzzle is figuring out what "fill with" means. Try working backwards - you have two examples to
        work with.<br>
        What do the example words have in place of the circles? Where could these have come from?
    </div>-->
    <div slot="explain">
        In this puzzle, "fill with" means to replace the circle symbols with the letters of the word "island". There are
        three words possible, with "shade" and "shale" given as examples. The final possibility is the answer, "shine".

        It took me an entire day to find a emoji/answer combination where this puzzle was possible. I was close to just
        dumping the original puzzle and making something different lol<br><br>
        One thing I ruled out very early was using the mikan as in the original - simply because some people would call
        it a "mikan", but others would go for something like "orange" or "tangerine", since it's a localized puzzle. In
        these cases, it would be extremely confusing if you run into a problem and then can't tell whether it's your
        approach or your citrus name. It would be impossible to make sure everyone is on the same page without heavy
        descriptions or hinting, so I just skipped the good fruit for today.<br><br>
        Also, this puzzle is once again something where in the original, the mere existence of kanji raises the
        difficulty of the puzzle by obscuring the reading of the words. So, in turn, I had two spots to fill in instead
        of one to make it a little harder here. The fact that "island" is twice as many characters as "mi-ka-n" also
        makes things harder, but that one I tried to soften by giving two examples instead of just one, so you can see
        more characters being used.
