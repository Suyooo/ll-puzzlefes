        Try writing out the puzzle text without the images. Is there anything catching your eye? Where does the
        replacement used in the example answer on the right come from?<br>
        You can also read out the puzzle text loudly and see whether you notice something. Try pronouncing the second
        word as wrong as possible.

        Replace "mikan" with "coral". Splitting up the word "coral", you can get "c or al".<br>
        Replacing the mikan with "al" gives you the example answer "allover", so using the "c", you can get the real
        answer, "clover".

        I HONESTLY CANNOT BELIEVE HOW PERFECTLY THIS ONE WORKED OUT AAAA<br><br>
        To quickly recap the original puzzle: "mikan" can be read as "mi-ka-n", the "ka" standing for an "or". So the
        puzzle, when read out loud, asks you to "replace the circle symbol with 'mi' or 'n'". At first, I was giving up
        on trying to copy this approach straight over, as I just couldn't find anything that worked with the ideas I had
        for the answer word. Finding a word combination that worked for the altered version of the puzzle still took an
        entire day! If you want to give it a try, <a href="/puzzles/11_chika_v1.png">here's what this puzzle could have
        been</a>.<br><br>
        The next day though, I decided to give it another shot, and just searching for "or" in the
        <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">Unicode Consortium's Emoji list</a> turned up
        the coral. Hey, that kind of fits, and works out, and now I just need to find a fitting answer! It was time to
        get the big guns out.<br>
        I downloaded the ENABLE word list, a public domain collection of 150000+ words, and wrote a script to look for
        every possible pair of words where "c" and "al" are the only difference. There's surprisingly many, actually -
        89 pairs! And this one was not even the only one fitting for Chika: another candidate would have been "alanine"
        and "canine" for the Shiitake shoutout. And I almost went for that one, because looking at the
        "clover"/"allover" pair, I thought it looked weird that the top hint would end up being "â—‹LOVER". I originally
        wanted it to be some weird hint that doesn't make sense as a word standalone. But then I thought that maybe, it
        could be another Chika-related bit. What could I put instead of the circle to make that work? Wait, I don't have
        any mikan in the puzzle right now...<br><br>
        And it was perfect.
